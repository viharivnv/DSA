All the programs were run on Pycharm.

The python version used is 3.8.1.

The steps for running the program are given as comments to each program.

All the questions were coded on the assumption that the key or data are integers.

Only Question 5 takes data from a textfile 'select-data.txt'.

Question 2 through 4 takes no input data but generates their own data.

Question 1 was given few commands to check the working of the functions. The main also contains a set of while loops to call these functions and pass the inputs entered by the user.
