Synopsis:
	 The program estimates the price of a stock after reading N-1 values and prints the predicted Nth value of the price for that stock. 
         The program runs on the assumption that α= 0.647  and β= 12.
         The test and training data contains no more than 30 target values of which the program uses first 29 values to predict the last one.
         The order of the polynomial is selected as '5' for this case as it gives the best predicted values for the selected constants.

Steps to run the program
1)Open PYCHARM
2)Create a new project
3) Add a new python file and paste the code
4) Run the code
